# Static vs Dynamic Language 

**Static Language** 


1)Perform type checking at compile time
2)Errors will show at the compile time 
3)Declare datatype before you use it 
4)More control


**Dynamic Language**


1)Perform type checking at runtime
2)Error might not show till program is run
3)No need to declare datatype of variables
4)Saves time in writing code but might give error at runtime
