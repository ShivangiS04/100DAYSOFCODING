Static vs Dynamic Language 

Static Language 
Perform type checking at compile time
Errors will show at the compile time 
Declare datatype before you use it 
More control


Dynamic 
Perform type checking at runtime
Error might not show till program is run
No need to declare datatype of variables
saves time in writing code but might give error at runtime
